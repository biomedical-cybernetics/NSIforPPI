function [x_rem, perc_rem] = random_link_removal(x, perc, method, rand_conn_maxiters, check_conn, show_warnings)

%%% INPUT %%%
% x      - adjacency matrix
% perc   - percentage of links to delete
% method - removal method, the possible choices are described below
% rand_conn_maxiters - maximum number of attempts for the 'rand_conn' method
%                      [optional, if empty or not given the default is Inf]
% check_conn - 1 or 0 to check if the network is connected or not
%              [optional, if empty or not given the default is 1]
% show_warnings - 1 or 0 to show the warnings or not
%              [optional, if empty or not given the default is 1]

%%% OUTPUT %%%
% x_rem    - adjacency matrix obtained by the removal process
% perc_rem - percentage of links that have been removed
%            it is meaningful for methods that aim to keep the network connected
%            since the value could be lower than the desired input percentage

%%% METHODS %%%
% rand       - random deletion of a percentage of links
% rand_conn  - random deletion of a percentage of links keeping the network connected;
%              links to the leaves are iteratively excluded
%              since they would certainly disconnect the network
% DFS        - random deletion of a percentage of links
%              excluding a spanning tree to keep the network connected;
%              the spanning tree is obtained by the DFS algorithm
%              starting from a random root node;
%              starting from the same root node the algorithm returns always
%              the same spanning tree, it means that the spanning tree to preserve
%              is randomly chosen only among at most N spanning trees, not among all.
%              This gives a preference to certain links to be not removed,
%              therefore this algorithm has the disadvantage that the choice is biased.
%              In order to reduce the bias, for every repetition the node indexes
%              are randomly permutated before running the DFS and then restored.
%              This modification does not limit the retrievable spanning trees to N.
%              Since the DFS function runs a mex file, it is faster than the UST method.
% UST        - random deletion of a percentage of links
%              excluding a spanning tree to keep the network connected;
%              the uniform spanning tree is obtained by the Wilson'algorithm.
%              Since it is chosen randomly among all possible spanning trees
%              with equal probability, the choice is not biased.
%              However, the method is slower than the DFS.
% mindeg1    - random deletion of a percentage of links ensuring minimum degree 1;
%              for each node, one link is preserved at random.

function tree = unispantree_wilson(x)

% The function computes a uniform spanning tree, a spanning tree
% chosen randomly among all possible spanning trees with equal probability.
% It is based on the algorithm RandomTreeWithRoot proposed in:
% Wilson D.B. (1996), "Generating Random Spanning Trees More Quickly than the Cover Time"
% It maintains a current tree, which initially consists of just the root.
% While there are remaining vertices not in the tree, the algorithm
% does a random walk from one such vertex, erasing cycles as they are created,
% until the walk hits the current tree. Then the cycle erased trajectory
% gets added to the current tree.
% The computational complexity is O(tau), where tau is the mean hitting time,
% the expected time it takes for a random walk between two random vertices.
%
% In this implementation:
% - the input network is assumed to be unweighted, undirected and connected
% - the root is randomly chosen among the nodes with probability
%   proportional to their degree (following the suggestion in the paper to
%   choose as root a random endpoint of a random edge to make the algorithm
%   more efficient in case of undirected graphs)
