function [matrices, percs_rem] = random_link_removal(x, percs, reps, method, filename)

%%% INPUT %%%
% x        - adjacency matrix
% percs    - vector of percentages of links to delete (example: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
% reps     - number of times that the removal process has to be repeated
% method   - removal method, the possible choices are described below
% filename - [optional] filename to store the output variables

%%% OUTPUT %%%
% matrices   - adjacency matrices obtained by the removal process
%              it is a cell of size [reps,length(percs)]
%              if it is a single matrix, it returns just the matrix (not a cell)
% percs_rem  - vector of percentages of links that have been removed
%              it is meaningful for methods that aim to keep the network connected
%              since the values could be lower than the desired input percentages

%%% METHODS %%%
% rand       - random deletion of a percentage of links
% rand_conn  - random deletion of a percentage of links keeping the network connected;
%              links to the leaves are iteratively excluded
%              since they would certainly disconnect the network
% DFS        - random deletion of a percentage of links
%              excluding a spanning tree to keep the network connected;
%              the spanning tree is obtained by the DFS algorithm
%              starting from a random root node;
%              starting from the same root node the algorithm returns always
%              the same spanning tree, it means that the spanning tree to preserve
%              is randomly chosen only among at most N spanning trees, not among all.
%              This gives a preference to certain links to be not removed,
%              therefore this algorithm has the disadvantage that the choice is biased.
%              In order to reduce the bias, for every repetition the node indexes
%              are randomly permutated before running the DFS and then restored.
%              This modification does not limit the retrievable spanning trees to N.
%              Since the DFS function runs a mex file, it is faster than the UST method.
% UST        - random deletion of a percentage of links
%              excluding a spanning tree to keep the network connected;
%              the uniform spanning tree is obtained by the Wilson'algorithm.
%              Since it is chosen randomly among all possible spanning trees 
%              with equal probability, the choice is not biased.
%              However, the method is slower than the DFS.

function tree = unispantree_wilson(x)

% The function computes a uniform spanning tree, a spanning tree
% chosen randomly among all possible spanning trees with equal probability.
% It is based on the algorithm RandomTreeWithRoot proposed in:
% Wilson D.B. (1996), "Generating Random Spanning Trees More Quickly than the Cover Time"
% It maintains a current tree, which initially consists of just the root.
% While there are remaining vertices not in the tree, the algorithm
% does a random walk from one such vertex, erasing cycles as they are created,
% until the walk hits the current tree. Then the cycle erased trajectory
% gets added to the current tree.
% The computational complexity is O(tau), where tau is the mean hitting time,
% the expected time it takes for a random walk between two random vertices.
%
% In this implementation:
% - the input network is assumed to be unweighted, undirected and connected
% - the root is randomly chosen among the nodes with probability
%   proportional to their degree (following the suggestion in the paper to
%   choose as root a random endpoint of a random edge to make the algorithm
%   more efficient in case of undirected graphs)

%%% INPUT %%%
% x - adjacency matrix of the network

%%% OUTPUT %%%

function percent = parfor_percent(N)
%
%   Function for monitoring the percentage of the parfor progress.
%   It works by creating a file called parfor_progress.txt in
%   your working directory, and then keeping track of the parfor loop's
%   progress within that file. This workaround is necessary because parfor
%   workers cannot communicate with one another so there is no simple way
%   to know which iterations have finished and which haven't.
%
%   1) Call PARFOR_PERCENT(N) before the parfor loop, N is the number of iterations.
%   It initializes the text file.
%
%   2) Call PARFOR_PERCENT inside the parfor loop to obtain the current percentage.
%   It updates and read the text file.
%
%   3) Call PARFOR_PERCENT(0) after the parfor loop.
%   It deletes the text file.
%
%   Example:
%
%      N = 100;
%      parfor_percent(N);
%      parfor i = 1:N
%         pause(rand); % Replace with real code
%         percent = parfor_percent;
%         percent
%      end
%      parfor_percent(0);
